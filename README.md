# CSE-3313--HW03
This is the coding assignment for Homework 3 for CSE3313 (Introduction to Signal Processing).

## Purpose
Learning how to process digitized data and to use a matched filter to identify the
correct value in the presense of noise.

### Process
* For each set of 10 numbers in the encoded message, determine which of the original
uncorrupted pulses it is closest to; classify it as a '0' bit or a '1' bit
* for each set of 8 bits, determine its ASCII valu
* translate each ASCII value to the corresponding character
We then are able to decode data-communications.csv into a human-readable message.
